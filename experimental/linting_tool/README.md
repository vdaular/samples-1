# Sample retired

The `linting_tool` sample has been retired.
Flutter's desktop support has evolved over the years and
the underlying data that this tool surfaced is no longer supported.

`linting_tool` was a successful sample of using Flutter to build desktop apps,
written by Abdullah Deshmukh ([X][], [GitHub][]) for Google Summer of Code 2021.
You can learn about Abdullah's experience creating the sample
by reading [GSoC '21: Creating a desktop sample for Flutter][medium].
