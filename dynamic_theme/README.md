# Flutter Dynamic Theme Sample

A developer sample demonstrating how to call on-device Flutter APIs based on
output from the Gemini API. Allows the user to dynamically change font scale,
colors, and other theme properties inside a running app using natural language.

## Goals

* Show how to use the Gemini API for a chat session.
* Demonstrate how to use functions calls with the Gemini API.
* Show how to tie responses from Gemini to specific local API calls.

## Questions/issues

If you have a general question about any of the techniques you see in
the sample, Flutter's open source community is a great place to find answers.
You can find links to online and local groups at
[https://flutter.dev/community]!

If you run into an issue with the sample itself, please file an issue
in the [main Flutter repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues).
