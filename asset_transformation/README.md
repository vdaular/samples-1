# asset_transformation

This project demonstrates the asset transformation feature. It includes an example
of a custom Dart package that can be used as an asset transformer. It also shows
how to transform an asset using a pub package that is compatible with the asset
transformation feature.

See the `assets` section in pubspec.yaml to get started.
